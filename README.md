### About
This app is about showing reactive approach in incremental search over external API. App allows searching for recipies from https://www.godt.no/api/.
The architecture for current app is developed with MVVMC and RxSwift.

### What is missing (not enough time for implementing)
Unfortunately errors are not handled properly.
This app shows a perfect way for introducing Dwifft library which was not managed to obtain.
The last commit show failed attempt to implement above.

### What is good about this app
The architecture is pretty clean and the events are handled in reactive way.

### Usage
You probably want to clone the commit one before the last one (which suppose to show how the app can be improved)

### Build
You just have to run pod install and then open .xcworkspace
